To begin with, this is a blog frame called Gmeek written by Meekdai you can create a repository and directly deploy it by clicking [here](https://github.com/Meekdai/Gmeek). I just wanted to include that here also to mark an interesting start to my written articles in the future.

To visit my own original webpage, redirect by clicking [miikkaarchive.com](https://miikkaarchive.com/), I am still learning HTML and thinking what I can add into this page, I also need to come up with a solution to make a portfolio for my photography works, but it will take some time.
